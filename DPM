​​DPM (Damage Proxy Map) Characteristics and Comparisons​​
​​Spatial Consistency​​: The high-value zones in ascending/descending DPMs and the EOS DPM (filename: EOS-RS_20250403_DPM_S1_Myanmar_Earthquakes_v0.5.tif) exhibit nearly identical spatial distributions, concentrated along the fault zone and in nearby cities (e.g., Mandalay, Sagaing).
​​Noise Differences​​:
The EOS DPM displays significant noise, manifested as:
① Irregular, dispersed patterns in mountainous regions;
② Anomalous high-value zones at data-stitching boundaries (likely caused by processing artifacts).
Water bodies (e.g., rivers) appear as null values in the DPM, but adjacent riverbanks show high-value zones, indicating damage concentrated in infrastructure rather than the water itself.
​​Seismic Fault System and Surface Ruptures​​
​​Primary Fault Structure​​:
The Sagaing Fault is a right-lateral strike-slip fault spanning 1,400 km, branching into a "horsetail-shaped" array of secondary faults (up to 100 km wide) at its northern terminus.
The main rupture propagated bilaterally along the Meiktila segment (460 km long, 20 km wide), releasing the majority of seismic moment. Secondary ruptures transferred slip through the Naypyidaw bifurcation zone, compensating for geometric step-overs.
​​Surface Deformation Signatures​​:
High-value DPM zones align with the fault trace, revealing its geometric configuration.
Integration with optical satellite imagery confirms surface ruptures, structural collapses, and river channel deformation along the fault.
​​Urban and Infrastructure Damage​​
​​Key Disaster Zones​​:
Cities near the fault (Mandalay, Sagaing) experienced severe destruction, including collapsed residences, schools, religious structures, and disrupted transportation networks—spatially consistent with DPM high-value zones.
​​Linear Damage Bands​​: North-south-aligned highways and urban areas (parallel to the fault) exhibit linear high-value DPM zones, reflecting roadbed subsidence or structural damage.
​​Rural and Geologically Vulnerable Areas​​
​​Surface Fractures and Soil Liquefaction​​: Sand boils, differential settlement, and cracks correlate with DPM high-value zones, likely linked to shear failure in water-saturated alluvial sediments.
​​Riverbank Instability​​: Localized high-value DPM zones along the Irrawaddy River indicate levee damage from lateral spreading.



The Damage Proxy Map (DPM), derived from satellite InSAR coherence data, highlights areas where radar backscatter characteristics have undergone significant change relative to their baseline background. High‑value regions on the DPM align closely with the distribution of the earthquake’s fault zone, indicating the presence of pronounced surface fissures and displacements in the vicinity of the fault.

Fault zones in central Myanmar exhibit pronounced geometric complexity that, across multiple scales, manifests as pervasive segmentation of rupture surfaces into discrete segments, step‑overs, and branching splays. At the largest scale, this complexity is epitomized by the Sagaing Fault—a right‑lateral, north–south–trending transform fault approximately 1,400 km in length—which, toward its northern termination, fans out into a “horsetail” array of subsidiary strands some 100 km wide. The primary rupture occurred bilaterally along the Meiktila segment of the central Sagaing Fault, releasing the bulk of seismic moment over a ~460 km surface‑rupture length and ~20 km fault width, while a secondary rupture propagated through the parallel strands of the Naypyidaw bifurcation—smaller in cumulative slip and rupture area but essential for transferring rupture across a geometric step‑over.

Moreover, the DPM captures additional changes and damage in areas that would normally exhibit stable coherence, such as built‑up urban districts, road networks, and exposed bare ground. Significant damage is evident in the central urban areas adjacent to the fault— In affected cities such as Mandalay and Sagaing, structural collapses encompassed residential complexes, educational institutions, and culturally significant religious sites, with historic landmarks and critical transportation infrastructure sustaining severe destruction. Urban zones proximal to the seismic source demonstrated concentrated DPM signatures matching observed failure mechanisms—collapsed masonry walls, sheared reinforced concrete columns, and destabilized multi-story buildings that resulted in civilian entrapment beneath debris fields. Meanwhile, towns and villages constructed along the north–south–trending highway, whose orientation parallels that of the fault and which likewise appear as north–south damage bands on the DPM.

Near the Ywawai region, where the fault traverses a northeast–southwest–oriented expanse of bare land, the high‑value DPM zones correspond to the spatial distribution of that exposed terrain. In this sector, the earthquake likely induced surface cracking as well as soil liquefaction, including surface sand eruptions, extensive soil displacement cracks, and differential subsidence across alluvial plains—features indicative of sediment saturation and shear strength loss during seismic shaking.
