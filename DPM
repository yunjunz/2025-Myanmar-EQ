Damage Proxy Map (DPM), derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) coherence data, enables the identification of surface deformation zones by quantifying significant changes in radar backscattering characteristics pre- and post-earthquake. The underlying principle is that seismic waves induce surface ruptures, fault slips, and secondary hazards (e.g., landslides, liquefaction), altering microtopography and surface reflectivity. These changes are manifested as high coherence loss areas (high-value zones) in DPM, directly reflecting both direct seismic damage (e.g., fault dislocation) and indirect impacts (e.g., soil liquefaction, building collapse).  

The central Myanmar earthquake’s main rupture propagated bilaterally along the Meiktila segment of the Sagaing Fault, forming a surface rupture zone ~460 km long and ~20 km wide. The spatial correlation between DPM high-value zones and the fault strike highlights two key features. First, the fault’s northern terminus exhibits a "horsetail" bifurcation (~100 km wide), where the main rupture traverses geometric stepovers via secondary branches (e.g., Naypyidaw bifurcation), captured by DPM as segmented ruptures and displacement variations. Second, prominent ground fissures and right-lateral strike-slip displacements along the fault are delineated by DPM high-value zones. In exposed bedrock regions, coherence loss directly correlates with gravel layer dislocation and surface fracturing caused by fault slip.  

In urban areas, DPM anomalies reveal concentrated building damage. For instance, dense high-value patches in downtown Mandalay and Sagaing near the fault correspond to structural collapses of historical sites, residential zones, and transportation hubs. Typical damage includes collapsed brick-concrete walls, shear fractures in reinforced concrete columns, and debris accumulation from unstable multi-story buildings, leading to entrapment risks. Infrastructure damage is evident along north-south highways parallel to the fault, where continuous high-value linear patterns reflect roadbed cracking, bridge bearing displacement, and slope protection failures.  

DPM high-value zones in fault escarpments and hilly terrains align with landslide distribution. Seismic shaking destabilizes colluvial deposits, with coherence loss corresponding to landslide crown cracks and debris flow coverage. Notable cases include landslides in northern Naypyidaw’s mountainous regions and the Min Kun highlands east of the epicenter along the Irrawaddy River’s western bank. Enhanced surface ruptures and slope fractures near the epicenter promote localized slope failures or rockfalls post-earthquake.  

Liquefaction-prone areas, characterized by saturated loose sediments (e.g., sandy soils), are identified by DPM high-value zones in southern Naypyidaw (Irrawaddy alluvial plain) and bare soils south of Ywawai. Strong ground motion in these regions may trigger sand boils, ground fissures, or subsidence, damaging roads and pipelines.  

By analyzing coherence loss intensity and spatial patterns, DPM differentiates fault activity (linear zones), building damage (patchy clusters), landslides (fan-shaped diffusion), and liquefaction (homogeneous areas). Without relying on prior ground data, DPM rapidly pinpoints disaster epicenters, facilitating targeted emergency response and resource allocation.
